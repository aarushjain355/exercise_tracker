# exercise_tracker

a full stack web app that customizes and produces a full set of exercise and diet plans for the user based on profile information. This project is meant to emphasize on the backend development and makes several third party api calls on the server side such as to Spoonacular and APINinja. Incorporates jwt authentication to verify users when signing in to their profiles. Unfortunately, due to some corruption, some of the frontend code got cut during deployment however it will be back up soon. Next steps for this app are to add in functionality for the user to enter their strava account and access their information there as well as incorporate opencv and some hardware for a more interactive approach to judge the user on well the exercise is performed.
